BLOATING PROCESS MONITOR

This plugin uses linear regression algorithm to determine if the memory
usage of a given process(by name or by pid) is growing up on time.
It was developed using Perl and internally uses the ps command line utility
to determine the resident size of the process. 

Optionally, the plugin gives you the possibility to generate a graph showing 
the memory increase. 

Requires the following perl packages: 

Statistics::OLS > 0.07 
GD::Graph::lines - Only in case of memory usage graph generation
